.. module:: avoidence

 :synopsys: Python node for robot's avoidence.

.. moduleauthor:: Fabio Conti <s4693053@studenti.unige.it>

Subscribes to:
 /laser_scan
 
Publishes to:
 /avoid
 
This node aims to activate a security feature for driving with the teleop_key modality. Thanks to the *subscription* to the ``/laser_scan`` topic, the node will be able to get info about the robot's surroundings. The subscription to the topic will give back the ``ranges[0,720]`` array to the subscribed callback. This data structure contains the distance values between the robot and the surrounding walls for a span of 180ยบ degrees in front of the robot. The array simulates the info that a set of lasers would retrieve in an actual environment.
The node will later elaborate the data acquired to publish it on the ``custom_controller`` custom topic through the ``Avoid.msg`` custom message.
